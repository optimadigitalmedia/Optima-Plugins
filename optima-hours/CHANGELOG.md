# Changelog

## 0.1.11.8 (2026-11-04)

- Optima release of upstream 0.1.11.
- **Files by the new Optima menu map (Overview, Your business, Content, Search and AI, Site health, Inbox, Build).** Shared admin kit 1.7.0: the same seven items on every site, the Build group hidden from everyone who is not an operator (Site Standard §7 v1.2).
- **Updates group in the shared Optima nav, and every group always shows.** Site Sync and the Change log sit under Updates (Optima → Updates holds every way of updating the site), Spam protection under Website, and the Events, Members, Partners, RV Park, Newsletter and CRM screens under Business. The seven groups show on every site; one with nothing on is greyed with a Turn on hint. Shared admin kit 1.6.0 (Optima Site Standard rules 11 and 12).
- The update check, the release feed and the plugin details now use `optimadigitalmedia/Optima-Plugins`. GitHub still forwards the old address, which is how this release reached the site.
- Optima layer revision 8: upstream b2d477b: release rings, Site log and Your site, seven-item menu, Site Sync creates pages; Booking, Newsletter and Writing not carried yet.

## 0.1.8.9 (2026-11-04)

- Shared updater: release channels. A site on the stable channel (the default) sees only normal releases, exactly as before. A site on the test channel (Optima Build, Build, Updates, Release channel, or `OPTIMA_HUB_CHANNEL` in wp-config) also sees test releases (GitHub pre-releases) and takes the newest version from either. Without Optima Build a site is always on stable. This release goes out as a normal release so every site gets the channel-aware updater; test releases start with a later release.

## 0.1.8.8 (2026-11-04)

- Optima menu, seven items (shared admin kit 1.6.0.0): Overview, Your business, Content, Search and AI, Site health, Inbox, Build. Each screen's group comes from its address, so a label change never moves it; every screen keeps its address. The eyebrow on each screen names its group, the word the sidebar shows. Screens opened from a button now have a page title (no PHP notice).

## 0.1.8.7 (2026-11-04)

- Optima admin footer: no personal email address. It reads "Built and looked after by Optima Digital" with a Request a change link (shared admin kit 1.5.1.5).

## 0.1.8.6 (2026-11-04)

- Optima layer revision 6: **hours fill the footer beside the address.** When the hours are confirmed and at least one day is open, they print in the theme's `footer-contact` slot as one line ("Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m."), so `optima_slot_has( 'footer-contact' )` is true only when there is something to show. Filter `optima_hours_footer_show` picks `summary` (default), `table`, `status` or `both`, or `''` for none; `optima_hours_summary` changes the words. Styles use the theme's type and `--optima-*` variables only.

## 0.1.8.5 (2026-11-04)

- Optima layer revision 5: visitor-facing styles now use the `--optima-*` design variables Optima Build 0.7.9.5 prints from the theme's DESIGN.md, so this feature dresses in each site's brand (plugin-first rule 7). Same look on sites without DESIGN.md.

## 0.1.8.4 (2026-10-31)

- Optima release of upstream 0.1.8.
- **The Plugins screen shows auto-updates as on.** The updater now reports the newest release even when the plugin is already on it, so WordPress lists Optima plugins as up to date and shows "Auto-updates enabled" instead of a blank column and an "Auto-updates Disabled" count. Optima plugins were already updating themselves; only the label was wrong.
- Optima layer revision 4: the port now carries the Optima-only work itself: editable pages in Optima Core, site-font widgets, full changelog history.

## 0.1.6.3 (2026-10-28)

- Optima release of upstream 0.1.6.
- Optima layer revision 3: the Optima admin screens use IBM Plex Sans for body text (Optima design system v2, October 2026), replacing Nunito Sans.

## 0.1.6.2 (2026-10-27)

- Optima release of upstream 0.1.6.
- Optima layer revision 2: the section nav styled on plain WordPress screens (the kit stylesheet gets its own handle, so the theme's admin stylesheet no longer replaces it), and icon chips on feature cards.
