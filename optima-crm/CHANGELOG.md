# Changelog

## 0.1.1.6 (2026-11-12)

- Added an uninstall cleanup. Deleting the plugin removes the backfill result notes and the cached release lookup. Contacts, tags and statuses live in FluentCRM and are never touched.
- Updates install only from the Optima Plugins release downloads (https://github.com/optimadigitalmedia/Optima-Plugins/releases/download/). A release listed at any other address is skipped, and an update of an Optima plugin from any other address is refused with an error.
- Every download is checked against the sha256 published in the version list before WordPress unpacks it. A mismatch deletes the file, stops the install with an error and writes a line to the PHP error log.
- A release listed without a sha256 (one published before checksums were recorded) still installs as before, with a line in the PHP error log saying no checksum was checked.
- Automatic updates run only for a package from the Optima Plugins releases.
- The GitHub API fallback reads each asset's digest as its sha256, so the check works on that path too.

## 0.1.1.5 (2026-11-04)

- Shared updater: release channels. A site on the stable channel (the default) sees only normal releases, exactly as before. A site on the test channel (Optima Build, Build, Updates, Release channel, or `OPTIMA_HUB_CHANNEL` in wp-config) also sees test releases (GitHub pre-releases) and takes the newest version from either. Without Optima Build a site is always on stable. This release goes out as a normal release so every site gets the channel-aware updater; test releases start with a later release.

## 0.1.1.4 (2026-10-31)

- Optima release of upstream 0.1.1.
- **The Plugins screen shows auto-updates as on.** The updater now reports the newest release even when the plugin is already on it, so WordPress lists Optima plugins as up to date and shows "Auto-updates enabled" instead of a blank column and an "Auto-updates Disabled" count. Optima plugins were already updating themselves; only the label was wrong.
- Optima layer revision 4: the port now carries the Optima-only work itself: editable pages in Optima Core, site-font widgets, full changelog history.

## 0.1.0.2 (2026-10-27)

- Optima release of upstream 0.1.0.
- Optima layer revision 2: the section nav styled on plain WordPress screens (the kit stylesheet gets its own handle, so the theme's admin stylesheet no longer replaces it), and icon chips on feature cards.
